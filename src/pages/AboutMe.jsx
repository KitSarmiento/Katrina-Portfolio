        <p>
          Hey there! I&apos;m Katrina Sarmiento, currently immersed in the world of full-stack web development at the University of Toronto. I&apos;m driven by the desire to combine creativity with technical expertise, crafting innovative digital solutions that leave a lasting impact.
  
          My journey into the realm of technology began with a fascination for how websites and applications are constructed, leading me to pursue a comprehensive education in web development. Throughout my course, I&apos;ve delved into various programming languages, frameworks, and design principles, aiming not just to learn, but to innovate.
  
          Beyond coding, I&apos;m passionate about creating user-centric, seamless experiences. I believe that technology is not just about lines of code; it&apos;s about enhancing lives, solving problems, and connecting people.
  
          My current focus lies in mastering the art of full-stack development, where I&apos;m learning to build robust backend infrastructures while refining my front-end design skills. This comprehensive approach enables me to envision, create, and deploy projects from start to finish.
  
          My ultimate goal? To leverage my skills and knowledge to contribute meaningfully to a tech company or exciting projects. I&apos;m eagerly looking forward to the opportunities ahead, where I can apply my skills, learn from experiences, and collaborate with diverse teams to bring exceptional ideas to life.
  
          When I&apos;m not engrossed in code, you&apos;ll find me exploring new technologies, engaging in design thinking exercises, or experimenting with personal projects. I thrive in environments that encourage creativity, innovation, and continuous learning.
  
          I&apos;m excited to connect, collaborate, and embark on this exhilarating journey in the world of technology. Let&apos;s build something amazing together!
